# decorator
Here, we have a few lines of code that explain decorators in Python. hope it will be helpful 

This line imports two functions from the time module:

    sleep: Pauses the program for a specified number of seconds.
    perf_counter: Provides a high-resolution timer for measuring time intervals.

Definition of wrapper:

    The wrapper function is defined inside the timer function. This allows wrapper to have access to func, the function being decorated.
